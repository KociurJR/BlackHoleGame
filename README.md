# Black Hole Game # 
--------------------- 
- two spaceships start at random positions
- they fly toward each other
- you can click to spawn a black hole
- if both ships reach the hole - they are saved - you earn a point
- their speed increases each round
- if they collide - you lose a life
- you have 3 lives
- press R to restart the game 
--------------------- 
game is made on the basics of mathematical technique called 'vector normalization'
it turns any vector into a unit vector (length = 1), so we know in which direction to move, no matter how far the ships are 
this makes the motion independent of distance and ensures that the speed remains constant and predictable
